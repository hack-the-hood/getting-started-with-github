###How does this apply to me?
We are living in a digital world and for version control beyond instant tracking like a google document, we can create schedules and magane a portfolio of design or programming work. Github is an online tool for collaboration and now hosting.

###What now?
Lets start by creating an account.

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and create an account

2. email alivia@hackthehood.org with your github username and I will add you to the Hack The Hood Organization

3. If you need help creating or updating a lesson plan or finding a schedule with your information please email or slack your question

4. Once you have logged into your github account and accepted your email invitation to join the organization, you should see a green button in the right hand corner of the screen that says new

5. Now that you have access to the organization you can add new repositories, if you would like to create a resource that you would like to share with the community, you want to create a new repo. Give it a name and now you have an empty repository. (folder)


###I want to create a new schedule
Here is an image of a sample schedule, that you can model

###Markdown
When you create a new repository, you probably want to initialize that repo with a README. Make sure you check the box marked Initialize with a README.
